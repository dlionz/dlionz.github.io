<p>Does your mind frequently obsess over things you find vaguely interesting? If so are you me? I constantly find myself late night divining into things I come across because my brain simply canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Be it Hearthstone, some fancy JS framework, DwarfFortress, in fact, the entire reason I bought a make was because I came across <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> the static site builder. For months I pour over the docs and videos and just fell in love with the idea of static site generators. Anyway here is a list of things I am loving right now. Maybe you will like them too!</p>
