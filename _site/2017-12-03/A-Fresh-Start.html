<p>Its the end of 2015, Im reading a blog post by <a href="http://anthonyramella.com/blog/from-zero-to-hired/">Anthony Ramella</a> in this post he talks about how he went from little to know coding expericnce to having a developer job in 5 months. Im currently fresh outta college stuck in a job I dont like wishing I could make more of this thing called life. So I quickly buy <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/html-css-jon-duckett/1110769868/2677974388410?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_DRS_Core+Catch-All,+Low_00000000&amp;2sid=Google_&amp;sourceId=PLGoP79700">John Ducketts</a> book and I start learning the exciting world of HTML and CSS. Few months later I fall off the wagon, Ive started a new job. One I thought would bring me into the exciting world of tech.</p>

<p>Smash cut to the beining of 2017 and Im back in the same place I was at the end of 2015. Im tired of waking up day and going to a job that doesnt fullfill me. I remeber that great article I read by Anthony. I start looking into Coding Bootcamps, and I promise myself that I will be a devloper by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Slow pan to me day one at bootcamp with a brand new MacBook Pro, excited as anyone can be. I had alot of self doubt coming into this mostly becasue I had this stigma baked into my brain that other developers looked down on “bootcampers” (turns out this inst true we just hear the loud angry people the most) and I really wanted this to work out for me.</p>

<p>Fade into me handing in my 2 weeks at work. The calander reads August 21st 2017. I had known I wanted to quit from the first of the year, I just wasnt sure when the right moment would be. Funny how it ended up being a week before the second most costly natural disastor in Us history until this point…Hurricane Harvey. My biggest worry in quitting was money. I knew I could be ok for maybe 6 months before I had to seriously consider taking a new job. But in this period of time I would dedicate myself fully to learning the ins-and-outs of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Cut to me getting a call from my mom saying “I have a freind whos husband has a software company”…</p>

<p>montage: “Meeting people”, “Wearing a button up”, “Petting a dog”, “Interviewing”  “Discovering Milk Tea is amazing”</p>

<p>spotlight, I am a developer.</p>

<p>final act.</p>

<p>I recognize that not everyone can just up and leave their jobs, that not everyone can afford a bootcamp, that I could have done all of this for free on the internet. I recognize that im not as good as I want to be and I will always think that. But Iam proud of every desicion I made and all the chances I took. I set out to acomplish somthing. I wanted to change my situation to a better one and I did it, and absolutly id do it all over again.</p>

<p>this blog will be a collection of my “whatevers”. I hope it can server as a learning device for me, maybe inspiration for you who knows. anyways, thanks for reading.</p>

<p>-Damien</p>
