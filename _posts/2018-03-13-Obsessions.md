# Obsessive Brain!

Does your mind frequently obsess over things you find vaguely interesting? If so are you me? I constantly find myself late night divining into things I come across because my brain simply can't stop thinking about it. Be it Hearthstone, some fancy JS framework, DwarfFortress, in fact, the entire reason I bought a make was because I came across [Jekyll][1] the static site builder. For months I pour over the docs and videos and just fell in love with the idea of static site generators. Anyway here is a list of things I am loving right now. Maybe you will like them too!

* [Jekyll][1] (code/blog)
* [React][2] (code)
* [HyperApp][3] (code)
* [Hearthstone][4] (game)
* [Overwatch][5] (game)
